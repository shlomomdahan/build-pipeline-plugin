        This file is included once in the build pipeline file - it is intended to allow a BuildCardExtension to contribute
        any 'global' scripts or assets to the build pipeline. This includes the ability to add a Handlebars helper
        (if you really, really must be using JS in a handlebars template).

        By default we just include helpers to append script tags to your build card
    -->
